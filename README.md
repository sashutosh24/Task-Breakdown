Key Functionalities:
Task Data:

Lists tasks related to vendor coordination, such as:
Engaged with Vendors
Designed Labels
Assured Quality
Managed Timelines
Assessed New Vendors
Consistency Checks

Customizes the chart with:
Title: "Vendor Coordination Task Breakdown"
X-axis label: "Percentage Time Allocated (%)"
Y-axis label: "Tasks"
Ensures proper layout and aesthetic settings, such as a consistent color scheme (skyblue) and edge color (black).
Visualization:

Displays the chart using plt.show(), offering a clear view of how time is distributed across tasks.
Libraries Used:
matplotlib.pyplot: For creating the bar chart and customizing the visualization.
Applications:
Task Analysis: Understand time distribution across vendor coordination tasks.
Process Improvement: Identify tasks requiring optimization or additional focus.
Presentation and Reporting: Provide a visual summary of task allocation for stakeholders.
